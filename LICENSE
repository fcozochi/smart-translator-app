### **Why This Works**  
- The screenshot `translation.png` is now **directly in the root folder** (no subfolders).  
- The path `translation.png` in `README.md` points to the image in the same directory.

### **Verify the Screenshot**  
After uploading, check that `translation.png` appears in your repositoryâ€™s root folder:

### **Still Not Working?**  
If the image doesnâ€™t display:  
1. Ensure the filename in your repository **exactly matches** `translation.png` (no typos).  
2. Use this direct link to test:  
   `https://github.com/fcozochi/smart-translator-app/blob/main/translation.png`
