### **How to Upload the Screenshot Properly**
1. **Create the `screenshots` folder**:
   - Go to your repo: [`https://github.com/fcozochi/smart-translator-app`](https://github.com/fcozochi/smart-translator-app).
   - Click **`Add file`** â†’ **`Create new file`**.
   - Type `screenshots/placeholder.txt` (this forces GitHub to create the folder).
   - Delete `placeholder.txt` afterward.

2. **Upload `translation.png`**:
   - Navigate to the `screenshots` folder.
   - Click **`Add file`** â†’ **`Upload files`**.
   - Drag-and-drop `translation.png` into the upload area.
   - Commit to the `main` branch.

### **Verify the Image Link**
After uploading, test the direct URL:  
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fcozochi/smart-translator-app/main/screenshots/translation.png`

If the image loads, your `README.md` will display it correctly.

### **Why Your Link Failed Earlier**
- The `screenshots` folder or `translation.png` was missing.
- The path in `README.md` used `App Screenshot/translation.png` (with a **space**), which GitHub treats as `App%20Screenshot/translation.png` (broken link).
