### **Why This Works**:
- **No spaces in folder names**: `screenshots` instead of `App Screenshot`.  
- **Case sensitivity**: Folders and filenames must match exactly.  
- **Direct path**: `screenshots/translation.png` is a valid relative path.

### **Verify the Link**:
Test the direct URL to your image (replace `fcozochi` with your username):  
`https://github.com/fcozochi/smart-translator-app/raw/main/screenshots/translation.png`  

If the image loads, your `README.md` will display it correctly.

### **Final Checks**:
1. Ensure the `screenshots` folder exists:  
   ![Screenshots Folder](https://i.imgur.com/5Ml5VvC.png)  
2. Confirm `translation.png` is inside:  
   ![Image in Folder](https://i.imgur.com/0L8hL9p.png)
