#### 2. Verify the Image Exists in `main` Branch
Your commit added `translation.png` to the `screenshots` folder, but ensure itâ€™s in the **`main` branch** (not a different branch).  
- Go to the `screenshots` folder in `main`:  
  [https://github.com/fcozochi/smart-translator-app/tree/main/screenshots](https://github.com/fcozochi/smart-translator-app/tree/main/screenshots)  
- Confirm `translation.png` is listed.

#### 3. Test the Direct Image Link
Use this URL (now valid after your commit):  
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fcozochi/smart-translator-app/main/screenshots/translation.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fcozochi/smart-translator-app/main/screenshots/translation.png)

### **Final Check**
1. Update `README.md` with the corrected image path.  
2. The screenshot will now display on your GitHub page.  

If you still see issues, share a screenshot of your repositoryâ€™s `screenshots` folder, and Iâ€™ll help! ðŸ˜Š
